# Databases - InvestmentTracker

# Enhancements Implemented

To support persistent, secure, and efficient data handling in *InvestmentTracker*, I integrated and optimized a local database using **Room**, Android's SQLite abstraction. Key enhancements included:

- Designing a **normalized schema** to store investment entries with clear relationships and minimal redundancy
- Implementing **DAO interfaces** for clean, testable data access logic
- Adding **query filters and sorting options** to support user-drivend views (i.e., by date, category, or value)
- Enabling **live data observation** to reflect real-time updates in the UI
- Applying **indexing and constraints** to improve performance and ensure data integrity

These enhancements ensured that user data was stored securely, retrieved efficiently, and displayed accurately across sessions.

## Skills Demonstrated 

This phase demonstrated my ability to:

- Design and implement a **relational database schema** tailored to app requirements
- Use **Room annotations and DAO patterns** to abstract and streamline database operations
- Apply **LiveData and ViewModel integration** for reactive UI updates
- Enforce **data validation and constraints** at the database level to prevent corruption
- Troubleshoot and optimize **query performance** using indexing and structured access

I also showcased strategic thinking in balancing database complexity with mobile performance and user experience.

## Course Outcomes Met

This work aligns with the following Computer Science Capstone outcomes:

- **Design and implement database solutions** that support application functionality and integrity
- **Apply principles of relational data modeling** and normalization
- **Demonstrate proficiency in database tools and frameworks**, including SQLite, Room, and DAO patterns
- **Integrate persistent storage** with dynamic UI components using LiveData and ViewModel
