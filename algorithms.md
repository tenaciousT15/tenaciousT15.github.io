# Algorithms & Data Structures - InvestmentTracker

## Enhancements Implemented

In developing *InvestmentTracker*, I applied key algorithmic strategies and data structures to optimize performance, ensure data integrity, and support scalable features. Enhancements included:

- Designing a **custom sorting algorithm** to organize investment entries by date, value, or category
- Implementing **search functionality** using efficient iteration and filtering logic
- Structuring data with **Kotlin collections** (i.e., 'List', 'Map') to support dynamic updates and user-driven queries
- Using **Room Database indexing** to accelerate data retrieval and reduce query latency

These enhancements allowed the app to handle growing datasets while maintaining responsiveness and clarity for the user.

## Skills Demonstrated

This phase showcased my ability to:

- Apply **algorithmic thinking** to solve real-world data organization and retrieval problems
- Select and implement **appropriate data structures** for performance and clarity
- Optimize **query logic and iteration patterns** for mobile environments
- Integrate **persistent storage** with structured access patterns using Room and Kotlin

I also demonstrated the ability to balance algorithmic efficiency with user experience, ensuring that backend logic supports intuitive frontend behavior.

# Course Outcomes Met

This work aligns with the following Computer Science Capstone outcomes:

- **Design and implement algorithms and data structures** that solve practical problems efficiently
- **Analyze and optimize code performance** in real-world applications
- **Apply theoretical knowledge** of data structures to persistent and dynamic storage
- **Demonstrate proficiency in mobile development tools**, including Kotlin collections and Room DB
