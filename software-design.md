# Software Design & Engineering - InvestmentTracker

## Artifact Description

This artifact represents the architectural and design foundation of *InvestmentTracker*, an Android app developed during my Computer Science Capstone in Fall 2025. It includes the MVVM structure, modular Composables, and UI logic that drive the app's user experience and maintainability.

## Justification for Inclusion

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to design scalable, user-friendly software using modern Android development practices. Key components that showcase my skills include:

- **MVVM architecture** for clean separation of concerns
- **Composables UI elements** for modular, reusable designs
- **Secure navigation and data handling** to protect user input
- **Real-time input validation and error feedback** to guide user behavior

These enhancements improved the app's scalability, user clarity, and resilience against common input and navigation errors. They reflect my proficiency in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and user-centric design principles.

# Reflection on the Enhancement Process

Enhancing this artifact taught me how to balance technical robustness with user experience. I learned to:

- Apply **modular design principles** to reduce code duplication and improve readability
- Implement **real-time validation** that supports intuitive error correction
- Use **ViewModel and state management** to maintain UI consistency
- Document design decisions clearly for future maintainers

One challenge was ensuring that validation logic didn't interrupt user flow.

## Course Outcomes Met

This work aligns with the following Computer Science Capstone outcomes:

- **Design and implement a software solution** that meets user requirements and technical constraints
- **Apply software engineering principles** to create maintainable, scalable, and secure applications
- **Communicate technical decisions** through clear documentation and user-facing design
- **Demonstrate proficiency in development tools and frameworks**, including Android Studio, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose
