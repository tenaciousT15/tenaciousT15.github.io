# Algorithms & Data Structures - InvestmentTracker

## Artifact Description

This artifact includes the algorithmic logic and data structure implementation for *InvestmentTracker*, created during my Computer Science Capstone in Fall 2025. It covers sorting, filtering, and data organization strategies used to manage investment entries within the app.

## Justification for Inclusion

I selected this artifact because it highlights my ability to apply algorithmic thinking and data structure design in a real-world mobile application. Key components that showcase my skills include:

- **Input validation logic** to ensure correct formats and prevent invalid entries
- **State management** using ViewModel and Kotlin data classes
- **Error handling routines** that guide user correction and feedback
- **Data modeling** to represent investment records in a structured, scalable way

These enhancements improved the app's responsiveness and scalability, demonstrating my ability to design backend logic that supports dynamic user interaction.

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process

Working on this artifact deepened my understanding of how algorithmic decisions impact user experience. I learned to:

- Apply **algorithmic thinking** to solve real-world data organization and retrieval problems
- Select and implement **appropriate data structures** for performance and clarity
- Optimize **query logic and iteration patterns** for mobile environments
- Integrate **persistent storage** with structured access patterns using Room and Kotlin

A key challenge was ensuring that validation logic remained responsive and intuitive. I refined my approach based on performance testing and feedback from instructors. I also demonstrated the ability to balance algorithmic efficiency with user experience, ensuring that backend logic supports intuitive frontend behavior.
