# Databases - InvestmentTracker

## Artifact Description

This artifact is the database implementation for *InvestmentTracker*, an Android app developed during my Computer Science Capstone in Fall 2025. It includes the Room Database schema, DAO interfaces, and query logic used to store and retrieve investment data. The artifact was created as part of the app's backend architecture and refined throughout the capstone project.

# Justification for Inclusion

I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to design and implement a secure, efficient, and scalable database solution for a mobile application. Key components that showcase my skills include:

- Designing a **normalized schema** to store investment entries with clear relationships and minimal redundancy
- Implementing **DAO interfaces** for clean, testable data access logic
- Adding **query filters and sorting options** to support user-drivend views (i.e., by date, category, or value)
- Enabling **live data observation** to reflect real-time updates in the UI
- Applying **indexing and constraints** to improve performance and ensure data integrity

These enhancements ensured that user data was stored securely, retrieved efficiently, and displayed accurately across sessions.

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process

Enhancing this artifact taught me how to balance database complexity with mobile performance. This phase demonstrated my ability to:

- Design and implement a **relational database schema** tailored to app requirements
- Use **Room annotations and DAO patterns** to abstract and streamline database operations
- Apply **LiveData and ViewModel integration** for reactive UI updates
- Enforce **data validation and constraints** at the database level to prevent corruption
- Troubleshoot and optimize **query performance** using indexing and structured access

One challenge I faced was ensuring that the schema remained flexible for future enhancements while maintaining current functionality. I also showcased strategic thinking in balancing database complexity with mobile performance and user experience.

## Course Outcomes Met

This work aligns with the following Computer Science Capstone outcomes:

- **Design and implement database solutions** that support application functionality and integrity
- **Apply principles of relational data modeling** and normalization
- **Demonstrate proficiency in database tools and frameworks**, including SQLite, Room, and DAO patterns
- **Integrate persistent storage** with dynamic UI components using LiveData and ViewModel
