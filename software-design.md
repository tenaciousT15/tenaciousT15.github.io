# Software Design & Engineering - InvestmentTracker

## Enhancements Implemented

Throughout the development of *InvestmentTracker*, I refined the app's architecture to support modularity, maintainability, and secure data handling. Key enhancements included:

- Implementing **MVVM architecture** to separate UI logic from business logic
- Designing **modular Composables** for reusable UI components
- Integrating **Room Database** for local persistence with secure data access
- Adding **input validation** and **error feedback mechanisms** to improve user experience and prevent faulty data entry

These enhancements collectively improved the app's scalability, user clarity, and resilience against common input and navigation errors.

# Skills Demonstrated

This phase of development showcased my ability to:

- Apply **systematic troubleshooting** in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose environments
- Architect clean, maintainable code using **MVVM and modular design principles**
- Implement **user-centric validation and feedback loops** to guide user behavior
- Document design decisions and code structure using **technical writing best practices**

I also demonstrated strategic thinking in balancing performance, usability, and security; especially in how validation and error feedback were integrated without disrupting flow.

## Course Outcomes Met

This work aligns with the following Computer Science Capstone outcomes:

- **Design and implement a software solution** that meets user requirements and technical constraints
- **Apply software engineering principles** to create maintainable, scalable, and secure applications
- **Communicate technical decisions** through clear documentation and user-facing design
- **Demonstrate proficiency in development tools and frameworks**, including Android Studio, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose
