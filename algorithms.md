# Algorithms & Data Structures - InvestmentTracker

## Artifact Description

This artifact includes the algorithmic logic and data structure implementation for *InvestmentTracker*, created during my Computer Science Capstone in Fall 2025. It covers sorting, filtering, and data organization strategies used to manage investment entries within the app.

## Justification for Inclusion

I selected this artifact because it highlights my ability to apply algorithmic thinking and data structure design in a real-world mobile application. Key components that showcase my skills include:

- A **custom sorting algorithm** to organize investment entries by date, value, or category
- Implementing **search functionality** using efficient iteration and filtering logic
- Structuring data with **Kotlin collections** (i.e., 'List', 'Map') to support dynamic updates and user-driven queries
- Using **Room Database indexing** to accelerate data retrieval and reduce query latency

These enhancements improved the app's responsiveness and scalability, demonstrating my ability to design backend logic that supports dynamic user interaction.

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process

Working on this artifact deepened my understanding of how algorithmic decisions impact user experience. I learned to:

- Apply **algorithmic thinking** to solve real-world data organization and retrieval problems
- Select and implement **appropriate data structures** for performance and clarity
- Optimize **query logic and iteration patterns** for mobile environments
- Integrate **persistent storage** with structured access patterns using Room and Kotlin

A key challenge was ensuring that filtering logic remained efficient as the dataset grew. I refined my approach based on performance testing and feedback from instructors. I also demonstrated the ability to balance algorithmic efficiency with user experience, ensuring that backend logic supports intuitive frontend behavior.
