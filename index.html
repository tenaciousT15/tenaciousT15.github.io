    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

    <p>Completing my Computer Science degree and developing this ePortfolio has been a transformative experience. This journey has sharpened my technical skills, clarified my professional goals, and prepared me to enter the field with confidence and clarity. Through each course and capstone milestone, I've grown from a technically curious learner into a systems-oriented problem solver with a strong foundation in software engineering, database design, and algorithmic thinking.</p>
    
    <h3>Strengths, Goals, and Professional Identity</h3>
    
    <p>This program helped me identify and refine my core strengths: strategic troubleshooting, modular design, and evidence-based decision-making. Whether optimizing reinforcement learning code in Python or designing user-friendly validation in Kotlin, I've consistently focused on clarity, reproducibility, and user experience. My ePortfolio reflects this mindset. It's not just a showcase of technical artifacts, but a curated demonstration of how I approach problems with rigor and empathy.</p>
    <p>My professional goals have evolved alongside my skills. I am now pursuing roles in system administration and database management, where I can apply my knowledge of secure architecture, efficient data handling, and collaborative documentation. I value transparency, maintainability, and user-centric design principles that guide both my technical work and my career path.</p>

    <h3>Collaboration and Communication</h3>
   
    <p>Throughout the program, I have worked in team environments that required clear communication, version control, and shared accountability. In group projects, I often took the lead on documentation and validation logic, ensuring that our code was not only functional, but understandable. I have also practiced stakeholder communication through academic writing and technical walkthroughs, translating complex decisions into accessible language for instructors, peers, and future users.</p>

    <h3>Technical Foundations</h3>

    <p>My coursework and capstone have reinforced my proficiency in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Structures & Algorithms: Structuring investment entries, managing state, and implementing input validation logic</li>
        <li>Software Engineering: Designing modular MVVM architecture, integrating Jetpack Compose, and applying real-time error feedback</li>
        <li>Database Design: Building normalized schemas, abstracting query logic with DAO interfaces, and integrating LiveData for reactive UI updates</li>
        <li>Security: Applying input validation, secure navigation, and constraint enforcement to protect user data</li>
      </ul>

    <p>These skills are not isolated. They are woven into every artifact and enhancement I have made.</p>

    <h3>Portfolio Integration</h3>

    <p>The artifacts in this portfolio represent a cohesive system of technical competencies. Each one builds on the others:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Software Design & Engineering lays the foundation for maintainable architecture</li>
      <li>Algorithms & Data Structures support robust input handling and state management</li>
      <li>Databases ensure secure, persistent data storage</li>
      <li>Validation & Error Feedback enhance usability and protect against misuse</li>
      <li>Security Enhancements reinforce trust and resilience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Together, they demonstrate my ability to design, build, and refine full-stack mobile applications with clarity and purpose.</p>
